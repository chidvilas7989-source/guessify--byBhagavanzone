## ✨ Features Explained

### 1. 60-second Track Selection 🎵

**What It Is:**
Host can choose ANY 60-second clip from any song using an interactive slider.

**How It Works:**
```
Song: "Bohemian Rhapsody" (5:55 total)

Position 0:    [═●═════════] → 0s - 60s
               (Piano intro)

Position 25:   [═════●══════] → 45s - 75s
               (First verse)

Position 50:   [══════════●] → 90s - 120s
               (Pre-chorus)

Position 75:   [═════════════●] → 135s - 165s
               (Chorus/opera section)
```

**Why It's Great:**
- Same song = infinite variety
- Can't memorize which part plays

- More replayable
- Keeps game fresh

TIMER EXPIRES
↓
Round 2: Host = Player B (next in sequence)
```

**Manual (Button-Based):**
```
Round 1: Host = Player A
Host feels ready to be member
↓
Host clicks [🔄 Move to Next Host]
↓
Immediately transitions to Player B
Timer resets to 3:00
```

**Smart Sequencing:**
```
Players: A, B, C, D (4 total)

Round 1: A → B → C → D
Round 2: A → B → C → D
Round 3: A → B → C → D
...

Within round: No repeats

(e.g., A hosts round 1, A can host round 2)
```

### 5. Real-Time Audio Broadcast 🔊

    ↓
